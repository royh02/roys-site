## Tools I used:

- ~~Selenium~~ (Deprecated)
- Discord.py API
- [Corona-API](https://corona-api.com/)
- Pyplot (Soon to be implement)
- Heroku Deployment (WIP)

## Why I made this:
I started this project at first to practice Python for my CS 61A class back in May. It was right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I loved sharing COVID memes on Discord, so this led me to play around with this bot. Eventually, I added a few more fun features, such as a COVID tester and a content rater (check out the repo if you want to have a laugh at the formula). I am still fleshing some code out and ~~the code is kinda messy~~. Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to learn more!
